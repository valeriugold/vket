- define first prototype: what features will it have:
  - no events
  - no S3
  - show files / user
  - download files one by one
  - remove files
  - watch files?

first prototype:
1
create user
upload files: store original name,size,md5sum
show files, original name, original size, original md5sum, stored name, stored size, stored md5sum
delete files
download files
when files are uploaded, they are stored locally

2 save on S3

3 download files bundled together

4 transcode files

5 create events, associate files with events

6 use different roles for upload/download


todo now:
upload files: store original name,size,md5sum
show files
delete files



- organize files per user/ event
- show current files
- there will be a intermediary func for transcoding, the final files will be stored transcoded to a common format... or not?
- modify DB and code to allow soring originalMd5sum (in user_file) before file gets transcoded
- the final file might be generated at a later time, long after the http req was returned

- analyze the option of uploading directly to S3
